# Yet Another Todo List - PHP

As the title suggests. this project is a simple todo list app written in PHP. But to make things more interesting, I built everything from scratch, that I didn't even plan to use composer for the autoloader.

The goal of this project is to learn the basics of PHP. and to test my skills so I wouldn't be locked into relying solely on some PHP framework
